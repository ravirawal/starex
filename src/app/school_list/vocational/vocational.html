        <p>School of Vocational Studies has been established by Starex University with a key thought of
            “Employability” in which the best training methods and pedagogy will be providing for developing
            necessary skills in order to ensure that the learners must get adequate knowledge and expertise
            in their particular field.</p>

        <p>Advancement of technology has caused a dynamic change in handling the task and the jobs are
            becoming skill-intensive or expert oriented therefore It is the need of the hour to reform the
            training approach and education system so as to improve the skills of the workforce with this
            thought, this school has essentially been designed for students wishing to enhance their
            employability which would facilitate such students in learning, earning and growing
            professionally.</p>

        <h2>UGC-B.VOC SCHEME</h2>

        <p>The University Grants Commission (UGC) has launched a scheme on skills development based on
            higher education as part of college/university education, leading to Bachelor of Vocation &amp;
            Master of Vocation (B. Voc. &amp; M. Voc.) Degree with multiple exits such as Diploma/Advanced
            Diploma/PG Diploma under the NSQF. The B. Voc. &amp; M. Voc. programme is focused on
            universities and colleges providing undergraduate &amp; post graduate studies which would also
            incorporate specific job roles and their NOSs along with broad based general education. This
            would enable the graduates completing B. Voc. to make a meaningful participation in accelerating
            India’s economy by gaining appropriate employment, becoming entrepreneurs and creating
            appropriate knowledge.</p>

        <h2>About B.Voc. Programme</h2>

        <p>Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc.) is a three-year undergraduate degree course, available in several
            fields for students who have completed their 12th standard or equivalent.</p>

        <p>The University Grants Commission (UGC), in 2013, introduced Bachelor of Vocation, commonly known
            as B.Voc. degree programme with multiple entry and exit points, which can be understood as after
            completing one year if the student opts for the exit, he/she is awarded a diploma certificate.
        </p>

        <p>Similarly, there are other exit points from where the students can take an advanced diploma or a
            full-fledged B.Voc. degree. The focus of this programme is to provide students with in-depth
            knowledge of practical aspects to handle the complexities of tasks in the real work environment.
            B.Voc. courses are considered to be a new generation training programme which emphases on
            industry practices and are carefully designed in consultation with industries/employers with an
            objective to make students industry-ready.</p>
